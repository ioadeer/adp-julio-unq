	abstract = {Observers binocularly viewed a target placed in a large open ﬁeld under two viewing conditions: unrestricted ﬁeld of view and reduced ﬁeld of view, as effected using a simulated head-mounted display. Observers indicated the perceived distance of the target, which ranged from 2 to 15 m, using both verbal report and blind walking. For neither response was there a reliable effect of limiting the ﬁeld of view on the perception of distance. This result indicates that the signiﬁcant underperception of distance observed in several studies on distance perception in virtual environments is not caused by the limited ﬁeld of view of the head-mounted display.},
