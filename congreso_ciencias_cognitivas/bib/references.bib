	abstract = {Observers binocularly viewed a target placed in a large open ﬁeld under two viewing conditions: unrestricted ﬁeld of view and reduced ﬁeld of view, as effected using a simulated head-mounted display. Observers indicated the perceived distance of the target, which ranged from 2 to 15 m, using both verbal report and blind walking. For neither response was there a reliable effect of limiting the ﬁeld of view on the perception of distance. This result indicates that the signiﬁcant underperception of distance observed in several studies on distance perception in virtual environments is not caused by the limited ﬁeld of view of the head-mounted display.},

	abstract = {Underperception of egocentric distance in virtual reality has been a persistent concern for almost 20 years. Modern head-mounted displays ({HMDs}) appear to have begun to ameliorate underperception. The current study examined several aspects of perceived space in the {HTC} Vive. Blind-walking distance judgments, verbal distance judgments, and size judgments were measured in two distinct virtual environments ({VEs})—a high-quality replica of a real classroom and an empty grass field—as well as the real classroom upon which the classroom {VE} was modeled. A brief walking interaction was also examined as an intervention for improving anticipated underperception in the {VEs}. Results from the Vive were compared to existing data using two older {HMDs} ({nVisor} {SX}111 and {ST}50). Blind-walking judgments were more accurate in the Vive compared to the older displays, and did not differ substantially from the real world nor across {VEs}. Size judgments were more accurate in the classroom {VE} than the grass {VE} and in the Vive compared to the older displays. Verbal judgments were significantly smaller in the classroom {VE} compared to the real classroom and did not significantly differ across {VEs}. Blind-walking and size judgments were more accurate after walking interaction, but verbal judgments were unaffected. The results indicate that underperception of distance in the {HTC} Vive is less than in older displays but has not yet been completely resolved. With more accurate space perception afforded by modern {HMDs}, alternative methods for improving judgments of perceived space—such as walking interaction—may no longer be necessary.},
