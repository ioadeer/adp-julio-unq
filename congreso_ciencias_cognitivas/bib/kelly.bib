	abstract = {Underperception of egocentric distance in virtual reality has been a persistent concern for almost 20 years. Modern head-mounted displays ({HMDs}) appear to have begun to ameliorate underperception. The current study examined several aspects of perceived space in the {HTC} Vive. Blind-walking distance judgments, verbal distance judgments, and size judgments were measured in two distinct virtual environments ({VEs})—a high-quality replica of a real classroom and an empty grass field—as well as the real classroom upon which the classroom {VE} was modeled. A brief walking interaction was also examined as an intervention for improving anticipated underperception in the {VEs}. Results from the Vive were compared to existing data using two older {HMDs} ({nVisor} {SX}111 and {ST}50). Blind-walking judgments were more accurate in the Vive compared to the older displays, and did not differ substantially from the real world nor across {VEs}. Size judgments were more accurate in the classroom {VE} than the grass {VE} and in the Vive compared to the older displays. Verbal judgments were significantly smaller in the classroom {VE} compared to the real classroom and did not significantly differ across {VEs}. Blind-walking and size judgments were more accurate after walking interaction, but verbal judgments were unaffected. The results indicate that underperception of distance in the {HTC} Vive is less than in older displays but has not yet been completely resolved. With more accurate space perception afforded by modern {HMDs}, alternative methods for improving judgments of perceived space—such as walking interaction—may no longer be necessary.},
